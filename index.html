                <h1>My journey as a music photographer.</h1>
                <p>After discovering digital photography in 2006, my journey as a music
                    photographer began.  From learning the necessary techniques using a 
                    small point-and-shoot camera at local shows to photographing national 
                    artists and festivals, it has been an amazing ride.  Come along as I
                    share some of the highlights.
