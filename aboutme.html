                    <h1>Hi!  My name is Linda.  Welcome to my blog.</h1>
                    <p>After discovering digital photography in 2006, my journey as a music
                        photographer began.  From learning the necessary techniques using a 
                        small point-and-shoot camera at local shows to photographing national 
                        artists and festivals, it has been an amazing ride.  Come along as I
                        share some of the highlights.

                <h3>A word about me...</h3>
                <p>Former registered nurse; current software developer; part-time music photographer.
                    I found I had a knack for capturing artists on stage, doing what they do best.  
                    I never expected it to be anything more than a hobby, but a chance encounter with
                    one artist changed everything.  He was impressed enough that he gave me a photo pass
                    the next time I saw them live, and continues to give me photo passes to this day, even
                    when they are playing in a festival setting.
                </p>
                <p>Over time, I got better at my craft and was able to get photo passes for just about any 
                    band I wanted to photograph.  Some regional websites ran my photos and after a while, I 
                    was able to team up with a writer and have some of my photos published in an international 
                    magazine.  Work and life in general have kept me pretty busy and unable to keep up with the 
                    photo thing as much as I'd like, but I still get out when I can and post photos on my own 
                    website.
                </p>
                <p>Besides music photography, I enjoy travel and have been lucky enough to get photos in several 
                    European countries in addition to many interesting places in the United States.  I'm also an
                    avid animal lover, having volunteered (and yes, taken pictures) at a local animal shelter.
