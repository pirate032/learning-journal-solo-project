                <h1>My journey as a music photographer.</h1>
                <p>After discovering digital photography in 2006, my journey as a music
                    photographer began.  From learning the necessary techniques using a 
                    small point-and-shoot camera at local shows to photographing national 
                    artists and festivals, it has been an amazing ride.  Come along as I
                    share some of the highlights.
                </p>
                <img src="images/pass-1.jpeg">
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>I had managed to sneak my old camera into some concerts back in the day,
                    but I didn't have a lens long enough to really capture the action.  Plus, 
                    film photography could get expensive and I was just a starving college kid.
                    When digitial cameras came out, the cost of taking pictures came down, and 
                    many artists began loosening restrictions on cameras at shows.  I learned
                    the necessary techniques by going to smaller shows where I could get close 
                    to the action.
                </p>
                <p>When I booked a music cruise for the first time, I made it my mission to get
                    good shots of as many of the artists as possible, so I would have something
                    more personal to get autographed on the ship.  Little did I know that cruise
                    would lead to a meeting with an artist who would help me get my photography
                    out of the "just a hobby" stage.  From an all access pass on that cruise to
                    my first photo pass to see the artist off the cruise, to photo passes to major
                    festivals the artist was going to be at, I was able to elevate my skills and 
                    photograph many artist and eventually get published.
